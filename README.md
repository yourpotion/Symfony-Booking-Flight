## Features

### Customer Interface

- **Booking Flights:** Customers can select destinations, choose travel dates, and specify the number of passengers.
- **Flight Details:** Provides information about pricing, available seats, and optional services like meals and luggage.
- **Final Booking:** The final step for booking tickets, followed by email confirmation.
- **Personal Cabinet:** Customers get access to a personal cabinet displaying future and previous flights, account balance, and online check-in services.
- **Optional:** Payment integration with third-party services and social login (e.g., Google, Facebook).

### Staff Interface

- **Role-Based Access:** Staff members have different roles: Gate Manager, Check-in Manager, and Supervisor.
- **Gate Manager:** Registers passenger boarding at the gate using ticket codes.
- **Check-in Manager:** Performs passenger check-in, adds options, and handles luggage fees.
- **Supervisor:** Has all the permissions of the Gate Manager and Check-in Manager, as well as the ability to manage staff, create/cancel flights, and manage options.

### ERP Entities

- **Flight:** Information about flights.
- **Passenger:** Passenger details.
- **Airplane:** Information about airplanes.
- **Seat Type:** Types of seats available.
- **Option:** Additional services and options.
- **Ticket:** Details of issued tickets.
- **Discount:** Discounts applied.
